\part{Preliminaries}


\chapter[Introduction]{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This vignette is to explain some pbdR~\citep{pbdR2012}
examples which are higher level
applications and may be commonly found in basic Statistics.
The purposes is to show how to reuse the pre-exist functions, and
quickly solve problems in an efficient way.
The functions built for examples may not be exactly same idea of original
\proglang{R}~\citep{Rcore}
functions, but can be adjusted in similar wa.
You are very welcome to use these as templates and rewrite your own functions
or packages.

We presume that the reader already has an idea about SPMD programming. If not,
please read \pkg{pbdMPI}'s vignette~\citep{Chen2012pbdMPIvignette} first.
Ideally, readers should run the demos of the \pkg{pbdMPI} package,
and go through the code step by step.

\section[Installation]{Installation}
\label{sec:installation}

One can download \pkg{pbdDEMO} from CRAN at
\url{http://cran.r-project.org}, and
the intallation can be done with the following commands
\begin{lstlisting}
tar zxvf pbdDEMO_0.1-0.tar.gz
R CMD INSTALL pbdDEMO
\end{lstlisting}
Since \pkg{pbdEMO} depends on other \pkg{pbdR} packages,
please read the corresponding vignettes if installations did
not succeed.
We also provide several demos for the capability of \pkg{pbdR}
packages which are explained correspondingly in the next few sections.
