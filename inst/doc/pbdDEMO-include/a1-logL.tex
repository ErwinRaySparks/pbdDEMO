\section{Introduction}

We first introduce general notations for likelihood function
which is a standard method for Parametric Statistics in
Statistical Inference~\citep{Casella2001}.
Then, we introduce multivariate normal
distribution\index{Distribution!multivariate normal distribution}
as an example to construct a likelihood function.
%Third, we apply this to linear regression model with normality assumption
%to errors and estimate parameters by maximizing likelihood.
%Finally, we implement a more general optimization method based on
%profile likelihood function~\citep{}.

Suppose $\bX = \{\bX_1, \bX_2, \ldots, \bX_N\}$ is a random sample,
which means independent identically distributed
(i.i.d.),\index{i.i.d.}
from a population which has a distribution $\mF(\btheta)$ with unknown
parameter $\btheta \in \bTheta$ where $\bTheta$ is the parameter space.
Suppose further $\mF$ has a probability density function
(pdf)\index{pdf}
$f(\bX_n; \btheta)$ provided an appropriate support.
The goal is to estimate $\btheta$ based on the observed data
$\bx = \{\bx_1, \bx_2, \ldots, \bx_N\}$.
Ideally, we want to infer what is the best chance ($\btheta$)
that $\bx$ is observed from.
Unlike in Mathematics, $\bx$ is known, but $\btheta$ is unknown
to be determined in Statistics.

Typically, a fancy way to estimate $\btheta$ is based on the
likelihood function of the data $\bx$
\begin{equation}
L(\btheta|\bx) = \prod_{n = 1}^N f(\bx_n; \btheta)
\label{eqn:likelihood}
\end{equation}
or the log likelihood function
\begin{equation}
\log L(\btheta|\bx) = \sum_{n = 1}^N \log f(\bx_n; \btheta).
\label{eqn:log_likelihood}
\end{equation}
Note that Equation~(\ref{eqn:log_likelihood}) has some
better properties for some distribution families and
is more numerically stable than Equation~(\ref{eqn:likelihood}).
We then maximize Equation~(\ref{eqn:log_likelihood})
over $\bTheta$ to obtain maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE)\index{MLE} $\hat{\btheta}_{ML}$ in either analytically or numerically.
See \citet{Casella2001} for details.

For example, Section~\ref{sec:ols} is one way to solve a linear model
without parametric assumption. An alternative way is based on likelihood
approach.
Assume an identical normal distribution with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$
to the independent error terms of Equation~(\ref{math:statslls}).
This implies a normal distribution\index{Distribution!normal distribution}
to the response $y_n$ for $n=1,2,\ldots, N$ that
\begin{equation}
y_n \stackrel{i.i.d}{\sim} N(\bx_n^\top\bbeta, \sigma^2)
\label{eqn:normal}
\end{equation}
where $\bTheta = \{\bbeta, \sigma^2\}$, and
$\bbeta$ and $\bx_n$ has dimension $p\times 1$.
One may construct a log likelihood based on the normal density function as
\begin{equation}
\log L(\bbeta, \sigma^2|\by) = \sum_{n = 1}^N
\left[
-\frac{1}{2} \log (2\pi \sigma^2) -
\frac{(y_n - \bx_n^\top\bbeta)^2}{2\sigma^2}
\right]
\label{eqn:log_likelihood_normal}
\end{equation}
The MLEs $\hat{\beta}_{ML}$ and
$\hat{\sigma}^2_{ML}$ can be obtained analytically for this case by
taking the first derivatives of Equation~(\ref{eqn:log_likelihood_normal}),
setting them to zero, and
solving the equations.




\section{Multivariate Normal Distribution}

The limitation of the Equation~(\ref{eqn:normal}) is it's
assumption, so we introduce a more general approach next for better
modeling. Since the independent assumption and Multivariate Statistics, the
Equation~(\ref{eqn:normal}) also
implies a multivariate normal distribution
(MVN)\index{Distribution!multivariate normal distribution}\index{Distribution!MVN}
to response variables $\by$ with dimension $N\times 1$ that
\begin{equation}
\by \sim MVN(\bmu, \bSigma)
\label{eqn:mvn_n}
\end{equation}
where $\bTheta = \{\bmu, \bSigma\}$, $\bmu = \bX\bbeta$ is a center with
dimension $N\times 1$, $\bSigma = \sigma^2\bI$ is a dispersion
and $\bI$ is an $N\times N$ identity matrix.

In general, $MVN(\bmu, \bSigma)$ has a density function
\begin{equation*}
\displaystyle
\phi(\by; \bmu, \bSigma) =
(2\pi)^{-\frac{N}{2}} |\bSigma|^{-\frac{1}{2}}
e^{-\frac{1}{2} (\by - \bmu)^\top \bSigma^{-1} (\by - \bmu)}
\end{equation*}
where $\bSigma$ is an unstructured dispersion but positive definite.
Excepting over fitting problem,
an unstructured dispersion $\bSigma$ is reasonable to
characterize the correlation of dimensions since the estimation of
$\bSigma$ is completely supported by observed data.

For Equation~(\ref{eqn:mvn_n}), the MLEs would be the solution of
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\bbeta} & = & (\bX^\top \hat{\bSigma} \bX)^{-1}
                   \bX^\top \hat{\bSigma} \by
                   \label{eqn:mle_beta} \\
\hat{\bSigma} & = & \frac{1}{N} (\by - \bX\hat{\bbeta})
                                (\by - \bX\hat{\bbeta})^\top
                   \label{eqn:mle_sigma}
\end{eqnarray}
which may require iteratively numerical updating.
For Equation~(\ref{eqn:log_likelihood_normal}),
the solution is reduced to
$\hat{\bbeta}_{ML} = (\bX^\top \bX)^{-1} \bX^\top \by$ and
$\sigma^2_{ML} = \frac{1}{N} (\by - \bar{y}\bone)^\top(\by - \bar{y}\bone)$
where $\bar{y}$ is the average of $\by$
and $\bone$ is an one vector with dimension $N\times 1$.


Suppose SPMD row-major matrix format is used for $\bX$ and $\by$, then
Equations~\ref{eqn:mle_beta} and~\ref{eqn:mle_sigma} can be implemented
as
\begin{Code}
\end{Code}

% Suppose we store data in SPMD row-major matrix format for this study.
% We implement a home-made function for log likelihood, and utilize
% existing \proglang{R} optimization functions to find MLEs.




%\section{Profile Likelihood}

% Equation~(\label{eqn:log_likelihood_normal}) can be solve by
% profile likelihood approach.
