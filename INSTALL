--- 'pbdMPI' Installation:
   See 'pbdMPI/INSTALL' for the details.

--- 'pbdSLAP' Installation:
   See 'pbdSLAP/INSTALL' for the details.

   See 'pbdBASE/INSTALL' for the details.

--- 'pbdDMAT' Installation:

--- 'pbdDEMO' Installation:
0. Download and extract 'pbdDEMO'

     > tar zxvf pbdDEMO_0.1-0.tar.gz

1. Default Installation:
   This should work with most platforms with 'OpenMPI' installed. The
   configuration is based on Rmpi but detect the flags and libraries from
   'mpicc --showme:*' which is more portable.

     > R CMD INSTALL pbdDEMO


--- Testing:
   Suppose 'pbdMPI', 'pbdSLAP', 'pbdBASE' and 'pbdDMAC' are all installed
   correctly.  I can run

     > mpiexec -np 2 Rscript -e "demo(ex_1,'pbdDEMO',ask=F,echo=F)"
