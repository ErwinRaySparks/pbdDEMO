--- 'pbdMPI' Installation:
   See 'pbdMPI/INSTALL' for the details.


--- 'pbdSLAP' Installation:
   See 'pbdSLAP/INSTALL' for the details.


--- 'pbdDMAC' Installation:
0. Download and extract 'pbdDMAC'

     > tar zxvf pbdDMAC_0.1-0.tar.gz

1. Default Installation:
   This should work with most platforms with 'OpenMPI' installed. The
   configuration is based on Rmpi but detect the flags and libraries from
   'mpicc --showme:*' which is more portable.

     > R CMD INSTALL pbdDMAC


--- Testing:
   Suppose 'pbdMPI', 'pbdSLAP', and 'pbdDMAC' are all installed correctly.
   I can run

     > mpiexec -np 2 Rscript -e "demo(simple,'pbdDMAC',ask=F,echo=F)"
