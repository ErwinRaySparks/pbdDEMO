\section{Introduction}

In modern statistics, likelihood principle introduced in
Chapter~\ref{chp:likelihood} has produced several advantages to data analysis
and statistical modeling. However, as model getting larger and data size
getting bigger, the maximization of likelihood function becomes infeasible
analytically and numerically. Bayesian statistics based on Bayes theorem
somehow relieves the burden of optimization, but it changes the way of
statistical inference.

In likelihood principle, we based on maximum likelihood
estimators for estimations, hypothesis testings, confidence intervals, etc.
In Bayesian framework, we make inference based on posterior distribution,
which is a composition of likelihood and prior information,
such as for posterior means and creditable intervals.
For more information about Bayesian statistics, readers are encouraged to
read~\citet{Berger1993,Gelman2003}.

Mathematically, we denote $\pi(\btheta|\bx)$ for posterior, $p(\bx|\btheta)$
for likelihood, and $\pi(\btheta)$ for prior where $\bx$ is a collection of
data and $\btheta$ is a set of interesting parameters. The idea of Bayes
theorem says
\begin{eqnarray}
\pi(\btheta|\bx)
& = & \frac{p(\bx|\btheta) \pi(\btheta)}{\int p(\bx|\btheta) \pi(\btheta) d\btheta}
      \label{eqn:bayes_theorem} \\
& \propto & p(\bx|\btheta) \pi(\btheta)
            \label{eqn:propto}
\end{eqnarray}
in short, the posterior is proportional to the product of likelihood and prior.
Note that the integral denominator of Equation~(\ref{eqn:bayes_theorem}) can be
seen as a normalizing constant, and is usually ignorable in most of Bayesian
calculation, then Equation~(\ref{eqn:propto}) provides great reduction tricks
for analytical and simulated solutions. 

For example, suppose $\bx = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ are random samples from
$N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ where $\mu$ is unknown and needed to be inferred
(i.e. $\btheta = \{\mu\}$), and
$\sigma^2$ is known. Suppose further $\mu$ has a prior distribution
$N(\mu_0, \sigma_0^2)$ where $\mu_0$ and $\sigma_0^2$ are hypothetically known.
After a few calculation, we have the posterior for $\mu | \bx$
denoted by conventional syntaxes next.
\begin{eqnarray}
\bx & \stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim} & N(\mu, \sigma^2) \label{eqn:normal_prior} \\
\mu & \sim & N(\mu_0, \sigma_0^2) \label{eqn:normal_likelihood} \\
\mu|\bx & \sim & N(\mu_n, \sigma_n^2) \label{eqn:normal_posterior}
\end{eqnarray}
where
$\mu_n = \sigma_n^2
       \left(\frac{\mu_0}{\sigma_0^2} + \frac{n\bar{x}}{\sigma^2} \right)$,
$\sigma_n^2
 = \left(\frac{1}{\sigma_0^2} + \frac{n}{\sigma^2} \right)^{-1}$,
and $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i$.
This means the posterior mean of location parameter $\mu$ is estimated by
weighted the sample mean $\bar{x}$ and the prior mean $\mu_0$ via their
precisions $\sigma^2$ and $\sigma_0^2$. A nice interpretation of the posterior
mean is that it combines information of data (sample mean) and knowledge (prior)
together into the model Equation~(\ref{eqn:normal_posterior}).
Further, a new prediction of $x$ given this model is also a normal
distribution that
\begin{equation}
\hat{x} \sim N(\mu_n, \sigma_n^2 + \sigma^2).
\label{eqn:normal_prediction}
\end{equation}

In this example, the prior and the posterior are both normal distributions
that we call this kind of prior as a conjugate prior.\index{conjugate prior}
In general, a conjugate prior may
not exist and may not have a good interpretation to the application.
The advantage is that the analytical solution is feasible for conjugate
cases. However, a prior may be better to borrow from known information such as
previous experiments or domain knowledge. For instance, empirical Bayes
relies on empirical data information, or non-informative priors provide
wider range of parameters. Nevertheless,
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\index{MCMC}
is a typical solution when an analytical solution is tedious.


\section{Hastings-Metropolis Algorithm}
\index{Algorithm!Hastings-Metropolis}

In reality, a proposed distribution may not be easy to obtain samples or
to generate from, while Acceptant-Rejection Sampling
algorithm~\index{Algorithm!Acceptant-Rejection Sampling} is a fundamental
method in Computational Statistics to deal with this situation by generating
data from a relative easier distribution and based on the acceptant-rejection
probability to keep or drop the samples. See~\citet{Ross1996} for more details
about Acceptant-Rejection Sampling algorithm.

Hastings-Metropolis algorithm~\citep{Hastings1970,Metropolis1953}
is one of Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to obtain
a sequence of random samples where a proposed distribution is difficult to
sample from. The idea is to utilize Acceptant-Rejection Sampling algorithm
to sample sequentially from conditional distributions provided relative
easier than the proposed distribution, and via acceptance rejection
probability to screen appropriate data from an equilibrium distribution.
The computation of $\pi$ in Section~\ref{sec:monte_carlo}
is an example of Acceptant-Rejection Sampling algorithm for
Monte Carlo case but without Markov Chain.

Suppose a stationary distribution exists for $\theta$ in the domain of
investigation $\Theta$. Provided the Markov Chain is adequate
(periodic, irreducible, time reversible, ...), we may have
\begin{equation}
\pi(\theta^{(i)}) p(\theta | \theta^{(i)}) =
\pi(\theta) p(\theta^{(i)} | \theta)
\label{eqn:transition}
\end{equation}
where $p(\theta | \theta^{(i)})$ is a transition probability at the $i$-th step
from the current state $\theta^{(i)}$ to a new state $\theta$ for all
$\theta^{(i)}, \theta \in \Theta$.
Since $p(\theta | \theta^{(i)})$ may not be easy to sample, Hastings-Metropolis
algorithm suggests a proposal distribution $q(\theta | \theta^{(i)})$ with an
acceptant probability $a(\theta | \theta^{(i)})$ such that
\begin{equation}
a(\theta | \theta^{(i)}) =
\frac{p(\theta | \theta^{(i)})}{q(\theta | \theta^{(i)})}.
\label{eqn:accpetance}
\end{equation}
Equation~(\ref{eqn:transition}) becomes
\begin{equation}
\frac{a(\theta | \theta^{(i)})}{a(\theta^{(i)} | \theta)}
=
\frac{\pi(\theta) q(\theta^{(i)} | \theta)}{
      \pi(\theta^{(i)}) q(\theta | \theta^{(i)})}.
\label{eqn:acceptant_rejection}
\end{equation}
The acceptant probability will be
\begin{equation}
a(\theta | \theta^{(i)}) = \min \left\{
1,
\frac{\pi(\theta) q(\theta^{(i)} | \theta)}{
      \pi(\theta^{(i)}) q(\theta | \theta^{(i)})}
\right\}
\label{eqn:acceptant_probability}
\end{equation}
that
$\theta^{(i+1)} = \theta$ if accepted, otherwise
$\theta^{(i+1)} = \theta^{(i)}$ (new $\theta$ is rejected).

The steps of Hastings-Metropolis Algorithm are summarized next:
\begin{enumerate}[label=Step \arabic*:]
\item Initial a $\theta^{(0)}$ from $\pi(\theta)$. Set $i = 1$.

\item Generate a new $\theta'$ from $g(\theta | \theta^{(0)})$.

\item Compute $a(\theta' | \theta^{(i)})$.

\item Genera a uniform random variable $U$.

\item If $U \leq a(\theta' | \theta^{(i)})$, then set
      $\theta^{(i + 1)} = \theta'$. Otherwise, set
      $\theta^{(i + 1)} = \theta^{(i)}$.

\item Set $i = i + 1$ and repeat Steps 2 to 5.
\end{enumerate}
Typically, we repeat Steps 2 to 5 until the process is burn-in, says
$I_b = 1,000$ iterations, after that we continuously collect $\{\theta^{(i)}\}$
for thinning every $I_t = 10$ iterations to release time dependent problems.
Repeat the thinning process until $I_n$ samples are reached. We also repeat
$I_c = 5$ Markov Chains with different initial values to verify the stationary.
The determinations of $I_b$, $I_t$, $I_n$,  and $I_c$ are dependent on models,
data, and prior, see~\citet{winbugs} for more information.

Although Hastings-Metropolis algorithm may solve complex problem, larger
number of $I_b$, $I_t$, $I_n$, and $I_c$ also result in time consuming
computations and large storage space. An easy way to rescue this burden is to
parallelize the algorithm. At least three possible parallelizations for $N$
processors can be considered in following.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Each Markov Chain is executed on each processor.
      Only $I_n / N$ samples are needed to be collected for each processor
      provided every Markov Chain is burn-in.
\item Execute one Markov Chain on one processor. Until the Markov Chain
      is burn-in, then the burn-in state is broad casted to all processors.
      Set different random seeds on all processors, then all processors
      proceed the Markov Chain until $I_n / N$ samples are collected for each
      processor.
\item For large size problem, distributing data is unavoidable, then $N$
      processors execute one common Markov Chain to collect $I_n$ samples.
\end{enumerate}
Note that the second one is only useful for short burn-in chains.
We next use a galaxy velocity example to demonstrate the first
parallelization above, and make statistical inference based on the
Bayesian framework.




\section[Galaxy Velocity]{Galaxy Velocity}
\label{sec:galaxy}

Velocities of 82 galaxies in the region of Corona Borealis are
measured and reported in~\citep{Roeder1990}, and the \code{galaxies} dataset is
available in \pkg{MASS}~\index{Package!\pkg{MASS}} package of \proglang{R}.
The mean is about $20,828.17$ km/sec and the standard deviation is about
$4,563.758$ km/sec. Figure~\ref{fig:galaxy} shows the distribution of data.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=3.0in]{pbdDEMO-include/pics/galaxy_1}
  \includegraphics[width=3.0in]{pbdDEMO-include/pics/galaxy_2}
\caption{Histograms of velocities of 82 galaxies. The left plot is based on
default setting of \code{hist(galaxies)} and the right plot is based on
\code{hist(galaxies, nclass=50)} providing more details of distribution.}
\label{fig:galaxy}
\end{figure}

Suppose we are interesting in the mean velocity of those galaxies and want to
model them as Equations~(\ref{eqn:normal_prior}), (\ref{eqn:normal_likelihood}),
and (\ref{eqn:normal_posterior}).
An example code is given in the \pkg{pbdDEMO} demo via
\begin{lstlisting}
### At the shell prompt, run the demo with 4 processors by
### (Use Rscript.exe for windows system)
mpiexec -np 4 Rscript -e "demo(mcmc_galaxy,'pbdDEMO',ask=F,echo=F)"
\end{lstlisting}
which provides Figure~\ref{fig:mcmc_galaxy}.
